	 A festival or commonly known as a “Fiesta” is part of the Filipino culture.
	Each city or province has a local fiesta.Being a very religious centered country
	a fiesta iscommonly about the celebration of a city or province’s patron saint or
	of harvest.There is a fiesta going on at any time in the Philippines. A fiesta is
	a special time with a banquet for kin and friends.They are always colorful and unique.
	Like most Asian countries; the Philippines is rich in culture and tradition. Arteche
	eastern samar celebrates its annual town fiesta every August 30-31 in honour of its Patron
	Saint, St.Raymund Nonnatus. Artechehanons rely mostly on fishing and farming as main sources
	of their livelihood. Diverse aquatic marine life inhabits the sea of Arteche. In fact, the town’s
	Taklaan Festival was named, after a pistol shrimp or“tabakla”,that is endemic in the coastal towns of Eastern Samar.<br><br>
	There are all sorts of activities such as games, contests, procession and a parade that serve as the highlight.
	It takes weeks or even months to prepare for a fiesta, surprisingly both the rich and poor make the same amount,
	of effort in preparation; during a fiesta everyone is equal. The fiesta  always colorful, always accompanied by music,
	feasting, and camaraderie is  importance on a town’s calendar. Festivals are one of the reasons why local tourism is growing;
	tourists who experienced these festivals keep coming back to see more. Popular festivals attracts millions of tourists and have,
