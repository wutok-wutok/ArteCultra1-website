	Po is a short term sentence that we use for asking or replying to the elders that we don't know what he/she is asking or talking to us or we called us for. Example: Your mother is called you to buy some ingredients, and you need to clarify the sentence of your mother. Opo is also a short term sentence that we use for replying an elder or an question. Even when your teacher ask you, a stranger asked a direction or the saleslady ask your needs.
