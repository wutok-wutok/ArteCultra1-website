 Katsarit or the christmas carolling season in the province and in contrast to the " freewheeling " carolling practices in the other part of the country.The one in Este is unique and special. There are unwritten rules the most important of which is you can do it only between the 16th and 24th of December . Otherwise,you will be reprimanded by the old folks and you will surely be mahiblungan ( Something like cursed ). The song itself is beautiful; it narrates the ordeal of Joseph and Mary as they searched  for a house in which Mary could rest and give birth to Jesus. The lyric are simple but informative and can fit to the tunes of many other popular song.The children use the simple tunes, teenagers and " oldies " prefer the melodious versions which are really pleasing to hear especially with guitar or band accompaniment.
